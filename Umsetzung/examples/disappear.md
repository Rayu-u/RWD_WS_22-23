# Disappear Example

The `disappear` class activates the disappear behavior.

The `disappear__500ms` and `disappear__750ms` classes determine at what point the element should stop being rendered.

```html
<div class="disappear disappear__500ms"></div>
<div class="disappear disappear__750ms ..." ...="...">...</div>
```
